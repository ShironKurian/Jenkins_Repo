Jenkins Integration with GitHub for Automated CI/CD
Overview
This lab focuses on configuing the Jenkins to automatically trigger builds from a GitHub repository whenever changes are detected. You will create a CI/CD pipeline for your chosen application (excluding GoLang), which will include stages for building, testing, and notifying the team about the results.

Objectives
Integrate Jenkins with GitHub to trigger builds on code changes.
Set up a Jenkins pipeline job to automate the build, test, and notification processes.
Choose one of the two triggering approaches: polling or webhook-based, to automate the process.
High-Level Requirements
Set Up Jenkins Integration with GitHub
Connect Jenkins to GitHub:
Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.
Connect Jenkins to your GitHub repository using the provided credentials.
Specify a branch to monitor (e.g., main or develop).
Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job
Create a new Jenkins pipeline job for your project.
Configure the pipeline to include the following stages:
Checkout: Clone the GitHub repository on each build.
Tool (Optional): Define any necessary tools required for building the application.
Build: Simulate the build process (e.g., compile code or echo build steps).
Test: Run a basic test command (e.g., echo "Running tests").
Deploy (Optional): Deploy the application to your chosen Cloud provider.
Notification: Set up email notifications to inform the team of build success or failure.
Choose Trigger Method
You will need to choose one of the following approaches to trigger the Jenkins build:

Option 1: Polling-Based Approach
Configure Jenkins to poll GitHub for changes at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
Use Jenkinsâ€™ pollSCM option in the pipeline job to specify a polling frequency.
Confirm that Jenkins triggers a build if a change is detected during a poll.
Option 2: Webhook-Based Approach
Set up a GitHub webhook to notify Jenkins when changes are pushed to the specified branch.
Configure the webhook URL to point to your Jenkins instance, using /github-webhook/ as the endpoint (consider using Ngrok or a similar service for local development).
Confirm that Jenkins triggers a build immediately upon receiving the webhook notification from GitHub.
Testing and Verification
Make a small change in the code on GitHub (e.g., modify a README.md file).
Ensure Jenkins triggers a build based on the chosen trigger method (polling or webhook).
Verify the pipeline executes each stage: checkout, build, test, and notification.
Instructions
Clone or create your GitHub repository for the application of your choice.
Follow the setup steps in Jenkins to create a pipeline job and integrate it with GitHub.
Select and implement one of the two triggering methods for automatic build triggering.
Test the setup by making changes to the GitHub repository and verifying Jenkins triggers a build.
Ensure the pipeline executes the build, test, and notification stages.
Document the integration process, including the chosen approach and how it works.
Reporting
Provide a brief report summarizing which triggering method was used.
Describe how Jenkins integrates with GitHub and how it automates the build process for your chosen application.
Notes:
Ensure Jenkins is properly installed and configured.
For webhook-based triggering, tools like Ngrok may be useful for exposing a local Jenkins server to GitHub.
Remember to configure Jenkins' email notification plugin to send success/failure notifications.
This README provides the necessary steps for your assignment and should guide you through the process of automating the CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and GitHub integration.
